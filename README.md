# GrandHealthAI Assistant

This project implements an intelligent health assistant powered by OpenAI that works via your personal Telegram channel, featuring long-term memory, note-taking capabilities, reminders, and the ability to process voice messages, images, and medical-related documents such as medical bills and diagnostic reports. It serves as your first-level assistant to share and gather opinions about medical symptoms, helping you prepare and become more informed about your health concerns.
